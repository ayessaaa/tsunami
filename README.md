# tsunami
#### listen to anonymous music recommendations! 
>https://tsunami.yessa.hackclub.app/

### what's this?
a web app to share music recommendations anonymously. u can write letters with songs in it and wait for others to respond and give u a song recommendation as well!

i thought it might be cool to make an anon song reco and name the website from my fav song, tsunami - niki! i also wanted to create a website that's more customized and so i did all the drawings and even the font is my handwriting :)
